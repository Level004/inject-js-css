# inject-js-css
This is where i keep my stuff for injecting Js and CSS for pages i visit a lot.

i use this chrome extension to inject my scripts: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-injector/edkcmfocepnifkbnbkmlcmegedeikdeb

if you don't want to cherrypick which scripts you want you can also import the JSON file that is in this repo to instnatly get all of my scripts.
